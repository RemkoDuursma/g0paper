	abstract = {Circadian resonance, whereby a plant's endogenous rhythms are tuned to match environmental cues, has been repeatedly shown to be adaptive, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Concomitantly, the adaptive value of nocturnal transpiration in C3 plants remains unknown because it occurs without carbon assimilation. These seemingly unrelated processes are interconnected because circadian regulation drives temporal patterns in nocturnal stomatal conductance, with maximum values occurring immediately before dawn for many species. We grew individuals of six Eucalyptus camaldulensis genotypes in naturally lit glasshouses and measured sunset, predawn and midday leaf gas exchange and whole-plant biomass production. We tested whether sunrise anticipation by the circadian clock and subsequent increases in genotype predawn stomatal conductance led to rapid stomatal opening upon illumination, ultimately affecting genotype differences in carbon assimilation and growth. We observed faster stomatal responses to light inputs at sunrise in genotypes with higher predawn stomatal conductance. Moreover, early morning and midday stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation, leaf area and total plant biomass were all positively correlated with predawn stomatal conductance across genotypes. Our results lead to the novel hypothesis that genotypic variation in the circadian-regulated capacity to anticipate sunrise could be an important factor underlying intraspecific variation in tree growth.},

	abstract = {* The role of the circadian clock in controlling the metabolism of entire trees has seldom been considered. We tested whether the clock influences nocturnal whole-tree water use. * Whole-tree chambers allowed the control of environmental variables (temperature, relative humidity). Night-time stomatal conductance (gs) and sap flow (Q) were monitored in 6- to 8-m-tall Eucalyptus globulus trees during nights when environmental variables were kept constant, and also when conditions varied with time. Artificial neural networks were used to quantify the relative importance of circadian regulation of gs and Q. * Under a constant environment, gs and Q declined from 0 to 6 h after dusk, but increased from 6 to 12 h after dusk. While the initial decline could be attributed to multiple processes, the subsequent increase is most consistent with circadian regulation of gs and Q. * We conclude that endogenous regulation of gs is an important driver of night-time Q under natural environmental variability. The proportion of nocturnal Q variation associated with circadian regulation (23–56\%) was comparable to that attributed to vapor pressure deficit variation (25–58\%). This study contributes to our understanding of the linkages between molecular and cellular processes related to circadian regulation, and whole-tree processes related to ecosystem gas exchange in the field.},

  abstract = {Gas-exchange measurements on Eucalyptus grandis leaves and data extracted from the literature were used to test a semi-empirical model of stomatal conductance for CO2, g(sc)=g(0)+a(1)A/[(c(s)-Gamma) (1+D-s/D-0)], where A is the assimilation rate; D-s and c(s) are the humidity deficit and the CO2 concentration at the leaf surface, respectively; g(0) is the conductance as A--$>$0 when leaf irradiance --$>$0; and D-0 and a(1) are empirical coefficients. This model is a modified version of g(sc)=a(1)A h(s)/c(s) first proposed by Ball, Woodrow \& Berry (1987, in Progress in Photosynthesis Research, Martinus Mijhoff, Publ., pp. 221-224), in which h(s) is relative humidity. Inclusion of the CO2 compensation point, Gamma, improved the behaviour of the model at low values of c(s), while a hyperbolic function of D-s for humidity response correctly accounted for the observed hyperbolic and linear variation of g(sc) and c(i)/c(s) as a function of D-s, where c(i) is the intercellular CO2 concentration. In contrast, use of relative humidity as the humidity variable led to predictions of a linear decrease in g(sc) and a hyperbolic variation in c(i)/c(s) as a function of D-s, contrary to data from E. grandis leaves. The revised model also successfully described the response of stomata to variations in A, D-s and c(s) for published responses of the leaves of several other species, Coupling of the revised stomatal model with a biochemical model for photosynthesis of C-3 plants synthesizes many of the observed responses of leaves to light, humidity deficit, leaf temperature and CO2 concentration. Best results are obtained for well-watered plants.},

	abstract = {{\textless}P{\textgreater}Leaf based models of net photosynthesis (A$_{\textrm{n}}$) and stomatal conductance (g) are often components of whole plant, canopy and regional models of net primary productivity and surface energy balance. Since C$_{\textrm{4}}$ metabolism shows unique responses to environmental conditions and C$_{\textrm{4}}$ species are important agriculturally and ecologically, a realistic and accurate leaf model specific to C$_{\textrm{4}}$ plants is needed. In this paper we develop a simple model for predicting A$_{\textrm{n}}$ and g from leaves of C$_{\textrm{4}}$ plants that is easily parameterised and that predicts many of the important environmental responses. {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater} We derive the leaf model from a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model of C$_{\textrm{4}}$ photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP carboxylase, light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco reaction kinetics, and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O$_{\textrm{2}}$ between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under most conditions these processes can be described simply as three potentially limiting steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats A$_{\textrm{n}}$ as first order with respect to either light, CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ or the amount of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition between limitations. The independent variables of the leaf photosynthesis model are leaf temperature (T$_{\textrm{I}}$), intercellular CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ levels and the absorbed quantum flux. {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater} A simple linear model of g in terms of A$_{\textrm{n}}$ and leaf surface CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ level (p$_{\textrm{s}}$) and relative humidity (h$_{\textrm{s}}$) is combined with the photosynthesis model to give leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed quantum flux, T$_{\textrm{1}}$ and p$_{\textrm{s}}$ and h$_{\textrm{s}}$ levels. {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater} Gas exchange measurements from corn leaves exposed to varied light, CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and temperature levels are used to parameterise and test the models. Model parameters are determined by fitting the models to a set of 21 measurements. The behaviour of the models is compared with an independent set of 71 measurements, and the predictions are shown to be highly correlated with the data. {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater} Under most conditions the leaf model can be parameterised simply by determining the level of rubisco in the leaves. The effects of light environment, nutritional status and water stress levels on A$_{\textrm{n}}$ and g can be accounted for by appropriate adjustment of the capacity for rubisco to fix CO$_{\textrm{2}}$. We estimate rubsico capacity from CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and light saturated photosynthesis although leaf nitrogen content or rubisco assays from leaf extracts could also be used for this purpose.{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Winter desiccation is believed to contribute to stress in coniferous trees growing at the treeline because cuticular conductance increases with altitude. To test whether winter desiccation occurs in high-altitude conifers of the Dolomites (NE Italian Alps), we measured minimum cuticular conductance (gmin), needle wettability (contact angle) and cuticle thickness in Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Pinus cembra L. needles from December to August. Samples were collected from adult trees along an altitudinal gradient from valley bottom (1050 m a.s.l.) to the treeline (2170 m a.s.l.). The treeline site is one of the highest in the area and is characterized by a generally low wind exposure. Altitude had no effect on gmin in either species. In P. abies, large seasonal variations in gmin were recorded but no changes were related to needle age class. Pinus cembra had a low gmin and appeared to be efficient in reducing needle water losses. There was a significant increase in gmin with needle aging in P. cembra growing at low altitude that could be related to a shorter needle longevity compared with P. abies. High contact angles ({\textgreater} 110–120°) suggested the presence of tubular epicuticular waxes on needles of both species. Contact angles were higher (low wettability) in high-altitude needles than in low-altitude needles. By the end of winter, there was no difference in contact angles between needles in the windward and leeward positions. Wax structures transformed toward planar shapes as demonstrated by the decrease in contact angle from winter to summer. In both species, the cuticle was thicker in needles of high-altitude trees than in needles of low-altitude trees and there was no correlation between gmin and cuticle thickness. Because desiccation resistance did not decrease with altitude in either species, we conclude that they are not susceptible to winter desiccation at the tree line.},

Over 1 year, nocturnal Js (Js,n) contributed 5-7\% of total Js in the eight species. The principal environmental driver of Js,n was the product of atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (D) and wind speed (U). Selected observations suggest that trees with higher proportions of young foliage may exhibit greater Js,n and nocturnal gs (gs,n). Compared with other tree taxa, nocturnal water use in Eucalyptus was relatively low and more variable within than between species, suggesting that (i) Eucalyptus as a group exerts strong nocturnal stomatal control over water loss and (ii) prediction of nocturnal flux in Eucalyptus may depend on simultaneous knowledge of intra-specific tree traits and nocturnal atmospheric conditions.},

It has been repeatedly demonstrated that thicker cuticle is not superior as a water barrier, implying that other functions must be important.

* Here, we measured the mechanical properties, dry mass and density of isolated cuticle from 13 evergreen woody species of Australian forests.

* Summed adaxial and abaxial cuticle membrane mass per unit leaf area (CMA) varied from 2.95 to 27.4 g m−2 across species, and accounted for 6.7–24\% of lamina dry mass. Density of cuticle varied only from 1.04 to 1.24 g cm−3; thus variation in CMA was mostly due to variation in cuticle thickness. Thicker cuticle was more resistant to tearing. Tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of cuticle were much higher than those of leaf laminas, with significant differences between adaxial and abaxial cuticles.

* While cuticle membranes were thin, they could account for a significant fraction of leaf dry mass due to their high density. The substantial cost of thicker cuticle is probably offset by increased mechanical resistance which might confer longer leaf lifespans among evergreen species.},

	abstract = {To identify environmental and biological drivers of nocturnal vapour exchange, we quantified intra-annual, intra- and inter-specific variation in nocturnal water transport among ecologically diverse Eucalyptus species. We measured sap flux (Js) and leaf physiology (leaf surface conductance (gs), transpiration (E) and water potential (\{Psi\}l)) in three to five trees of eight species. Over 1 year, nocturnal Js (Js,n) contributed 5-7\% of total Js in the eight species. The principal environmental driver of Js,n was the product of atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (D) and wind speed (U). Selected observations suggest that trees with higher proportions of young foliage may exhibit greater Js,n and nocturnal gs (gs,n). Compared with other tree taxa, nocturnal water use in Eucalyptus was relatively low and more variable within than between species, suggesting that (i) Eucalyptus as a group exerts strong nocturnal stomatal control over water loss and (ii) prediction of nocturnal flux in Eucalyptus may depend on simultaneous knowledge of intra-specific tree traits and nocturnal atmospheric conditions.},

	abstract = {Plant traits – the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs – determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40\% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation – but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

Temperatures may rise above critical thresholds that allow trees to function optimally, with unknown long-term consequences for forest ecosystems. In this context, we investigated how photosynthetic traits and the water balance in Douglas-fir are affected by exposure to three heat waves with temperatures about 12 °C above ambient. Photosynthetic carboxylation efficiency (Vcmax) was mostly unaffected, but electron transport (Jmax) and photosynthetic rates under saturating light (Asat) were strongly influenced by the heat waves, with lagging limitations on photosynthesis still being observed six weeks after the last heat wave. We also observed lingering heat-induced inhibitions on transpiration, minimum stomatal conductance, and night-time stomatal conductance (gs-night). Results from the stomatal models used to calculate minimum stomatal conductance were similar to gs-night and indicated changes in leaf morphology, e.g. stomatal occlusions and alterations in epicuticular wax. Our results show Douglas-fir’s ability to restrict water loss following heat stress, but at the price of reduced photosynthetic performance. Such limitations indicate potential long-term restrictions that heat waves can impose on tree development and functioning under extreme climatic conditions.},

In this review, we draw on the medical literature concerning human death to propose a water resource-based approach to tree mortality that considers the tree as a complex organism with a distinct growth strategy. This approach provides insight into mortality mechanisms at the tree and landscape scales and presents promising avenues into modeling tree death from drought and temperature stress.},

	abstract = {Low water potentials in xylem can result in damaging levels of cavitation, yet little is understood about which hydraulic traits have most influence in delaying the onset of hydraulic dysfunction during periods of drought. We examined three traits contributing to longer desiccation times in excised shoots of 11 species from two sites of contrasting aridity: (i) the amount of water released from plant tissues per decrease in xylem water potential (WΨ); (ii) the minimum xylem water potential preceding acute water stress (defined as P50L; water potential at 50\% loss of leaf conductance); and (iii) the integrated transpiration rate between the points of full hydration and P50L (Wtime). The time required for species to reach P50L varied markedly, ranging from 1.3 h to nearly 3 days. WΨ, P50L and Wtime all contributed significantly to longer desiccation times, explaining 28, 22 and 50\% of the variance in the time required to reach P50L. Interestingly, these three traits were nearly orthogonal to one another, suggesting that they do not represent alternative hydraulic strategies, but likely trade off with other ecological strategies not evaluated in this study. The majority of water lost during desiccation (60–91\%) originated from leaves, suggesting an important role for leaf capacitance in small plants when xylem water potentials decrease below −2 MPa.},

There are characters often cited as adaptations to water stress, but links between the function of these traits and adaptation to drying climates are tenuous. Here we combine distributional, climatic, and physiological evidence from 42 species of conifers to show that the evolution of drought resistance follows two distinct pathways, both involving the coordinated evolution of tissues regulating water supply (xylem) and water loss (stomatal pores) in leaves. Only species with very efficient stomatal closure, and hence low minimum rates of water loss, inhabit dry habitats, but species diverged in their apparent mechanism for maintaining closed stomata during drought. An ancestral mechanism found in Pinaceae and Araucariaceae species relies on high levels of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) to close stomata during water stress. A second mechanism, found in the majority of Cupressaceae species, uses leaf desiccation rather than high ABA levels to close stomata during sustained water stress. Species in the latter group were characterized by xylem tissues with extreme resistance to embolism but low levels of foliar ABA after 30 d without water. The combination of low levels of ABA under stress with cavitation-resistant xylem enables these species to prolong stomatal opening during drought, potentially extending their photosynthetic activity between rainfall events. Our data demonstrate a surprising simplicity in the way conifers evolved to cope with water shortage, indicating a critical interaction between xylem and stomatal tissues during the process of evolution to dry climates.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The ability of a plant to survive severe water deficits depends on its ability to restrict water loss through the leaf epidermis after stomata attain minimum aperture. At this stage, the rate of water loss is regulated by the epidermal conductance (gc). Low gc would be a useful selection criterion to identify genotypes with enhanced survival capability. Consequently, variation in gc among Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench genotypes was evaluated. Since there is little conclusive evidence linking gc with leaf waxiness, alternative hypotheses relating gc to stomatal trails were also examined. Epidermal conductance varied from 6.3 to 17.6mmol m−2 s−1 among sorghum genotypes. It was unrelated to stomatal pore length which varied with genotype and to pore depth which was similar for all genotypes measured. However, gc, increased with increasing stomatal density. This indicates that stomatal density plays a direct role in water loss even at very low conductances. The association of low stomatal density with low gc is consistent with the hypothesis that at the smallest stomata aperture, water loss from the epidermis above guard cell teichodes becomes a significant source of leaf water loss. Since low gc is directly related to crop survival under severe water deficits, it is recommended that genotypes with low gc. be selected using the selection criterion of stomatal density.},
