	abstract = {Plant survival of severe drought may be especially important in long-life crops such as pastures and rangelands, which might be subjected to prolonged water deficit at some time during their life cycles. While a number of plant traits have been discussed as being beneficial in increasing drought survival, there is virtually no quantitative evidence concerning the relative merits of these traits. This analysis was undertaken with a relatively simple model of plant water balance to calculate the duration of crop survival during exposure to severe water deficits. A low leaf epidermal conductance was an essential factor in prolonging plant survival under drought. The benefit of low epidermal conductance was greatest at a value of 0.10 mm s−1, which is less than has been typically reported for annual field crop species. Investigation of the variation and inheritance of epidermal conductance in crops that may be subjected to survival-threatening drought were identified as prime topics for future research. Once a low epidermal conductance has been achieved, additional increases in prolonging plant survival of severe drought can be obtained as a result of leaf shedding and a low lethal relative water content for leaves.},

	abstract = {Stomatal conductance (gs) is a key land-surface attribute as it links transpiration, the dominant component of global land evapotranspiration, and photosynthesis, the driving force of the global carbon cycle. Despite the pivotal role of gs in predictions of global water and carbon cycle changes, a global-scale database and an associated globally applicable model of gs that allow predictions of stomatal behaviour are lacking. Here, we present a database of globally distributed gs obtained in the field for a wide range of plant functional types (PFTs) and biomes. We find that stomatal behaviour differs among PFTs according to their marginal carbon cost of water use, as predicted by the theory underpinning the optimal stomatal model and the leaf and wood economics spectrum. We also demonstrate a global relationship with climate. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviour of gs across biomes and across PFTs that can be applied to regional, continental and global-scale modelling of ecosystem productivity, energy balance and ecohydrological processes in a future changing climate.},

	abstract = {Peanut genotypes from the US mini-core collection were analysed for changes in leaf proteins during reproductive stage growth under water-deficit stress. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1- and 2-DGE) was performed on soluble protein extracts of selected tolerant and susceptible genotypes. A total of 102 protein bands/spots were analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS) and by quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS/MS) analysis. Forty-nine non-redundant proteins were identified, implicating a variety of stress response mechanisms in peanut. Lipoxygenase and 1l-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase, which aid in inter- and intracellular stress signalling, were more abundant in tolerant genotypes under water-deficit stress. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a key enzyme of lipid biosynthesis, increased in relative abundance along with a corresponding increase in epicuticular wax content in the tolerant genotype, suggesting an additional mechanism for water conservation and stress tolerance. Additionally, there was a marked decrease in the abundance of several photosynthetic proteins in the tolerant genotype, along with a concomitant decrease in net photosynthesis in response to water-deficit stress. Differential regulation of leaf proteins involved in a variety of cellular functions (e.g. cell wall strengthening, signal transduction, energy metabolism, cellular detoxification and gene regulation) indicates that these molecules could affect the molecular mechanism of water-deficit stress tolerance in peanut.},

	doi = {10.1080/00380768.1987.10557590},
	abstract = {In order to clarify the relationship between water use efficiency (apparent photosynthetic rate/transpiration rate) and the synthesis and deposition of epicuticular wax and of lipids in leaf internal tissues in various forage crops with different drought tolerance, the contribution of cuticular wax to the leaf cuticular resistance to water loss under water stress was estimated. Under water stress conditions, the cuticular resistance of the drought tolerant plant Chloris gayana Kunth. increased about twofold compared with that of a well-watered plant, whereas the cuticular resistance of the sensitive plant Coix lacryma-jobi L. increased by about 10\%. The amount of epicuticular wax deposited on the leaf surface in both plants increased by water stress. However, the amount in the tolerant plant was much higher than those in the sensitive one. Radioactivity of 14C incorporated into the leaf surface wax of stressed C. gayana and C. lacryma-jobi plants was 27 and 50\% less than that of well-watered plants, respectively, when they were treated with 14C-malonate and 14C-acetate. Leaves of water-stressed C. gayana assimilated 14C from 14C-malonate and 14C-acetate into the lipids of their internal tissues 5.7 times more than the leaves of well-watered plants, while the leaves of water-stressed C. lacryma-jobi assimilated 78\% of the amount recorded in well-watered plants. On the other hand, the cuticular resistance of bloom lines of Sorghum bicolor L. with a high accumulation of wax on the epicuticular surface increased by about 90\% by water stress, whereas the cuticular resistance of a bloomless line with a low amount of wax increased by about only 15\%. Water use efficiency of bloom lines of sorghum increased remarkably by water stress, whereas that of the bloomless line of sorghum decreased. These data suggest that in the drought-tolerant plants the water retention ability of the leaves increased due to the deposition of a larger amount of wax on their leaf surfaces, and a higher accumulation of lipids in internal tissues. Also these plants produced larger amounts of dry matter by increasing the water use efficiency through the reduction of cuticular evaporation under water stress conditions.},

Epidermal conductance, therefore, appears to be a physiological trait which might well be utilized in a plant-breeding program for improvement of drought resistance in soybean, should further studies establish its utility for that purpose.},

Water content and viability increased for windward needles with height above the snow level. Below the snow surface, needle dehydration and mortality were minimal. Both absolute and relative water content were highly correlated with needle viability (a needle viability of near 50\% corresponded to a water content of about 60\% of dry weight). Air temperatures did not drop below -29°C in 1980/81, and needle mortality was not correlated with low nighttime needle temperatures. However, dehydration and mortality of wind-exposed needles were associated with low daytime needle temperatures and low cuticular resistance to water vapor loss. A preliminary experiment with excised shoots indicated that summer pre-disposition probably was not the primary cause of winter needle death, and that dehydration and death could have resulted from winter wind exposure alone, perhaps through cuticle abrasion.},
