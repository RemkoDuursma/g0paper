	abstract = {Research on methods of meta-analysis (the synthesis of related study results) has dealt with many simple study indices, but less attention has been paid to the issue of summarizing regression slopes. In part this is because of the many complications that arise when real sets of regression models are accumulated. We outline the complexities involved in synthesizing slopes, describe existing methods of analysis and present a multivariate generalized least squares approach to the synthesis of regression slopes.},

	abstract = {A novel framework is presented for the analysis of ecophysiological field measurements and modelling. The hypothesis ‘leaves minimise the summed unit costs of transpiration and carboxylation’ predicts leaf-internal/ambient CO2 ratios (ci/ca) and slopes of maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) or leaf nitrogen (Narea) vs. stomatal conductance. Analysis of data on woody species from contrasting climates (cold-hot, dry-wet) yielded steeper slopes and lower mean ci/ca ratios at the dry or cold sites than at the wet or hot sites. High atmospheric vapour pressure deficit implies low ci/ca in dry climates. High water viscosity (more costly transport) and low photorespiration (less costly photosynthesis) imply low ci/ca in cold climates. Observed site-mean ci/ca shifts are predicted quantitatively for temperature contrasts (by photorespiration plus viscosity effects) and approximately for aridity contrasts. The theory explains the dependency of ci/ca ratios on temperature and vapour pressure deficit, and observed relationships of leaf δ13C and Narea to aridity.},

	abstract = {A common approach for estimating fluxes of CO2 and water in canopy models is to couple a model of photosynthesis (An) to a semi-empirical model of stomatal conductance (gs) such as the widely validated and utilized Ball–Berry (BB) model. This coupling provides an effective way of predicting transpiration at multiple scales. However, the designated value of the slope parameter (m) in the BB model impacts transpiration estimates. There is a lack of consensus regarding how m varies among species or plant functional types (PFTs) or in response to growth conditions. Literature values are highly variable, with inter-species and intra-species variations of {\textgreater}100\%, and comparisons are made more difficult because of differences in collection techniques. This paper reviews the various methods used to estimate m and highlights how variations in measurement techniques or the data utilized can influence the resultant m. Additionally, this review summarizes the reported responses of m to [CO2] and water stress, collates literature values by PFT and compiles nearly three decades of values into a useful compendium.},

	abstract = {Leaf transpiration rate (E) frequently shows a peaked response to increasing vapour pressure deficit (D). The mechanisms for the decrease in E at high D, known as the ‘apparent feed-forward response’, are strongly debated but explanations to date have exclusively focused on hydraulic processes. However, stomata also respond to signals related to photosynthesis. We investigated whether the apparent feed-forward response of E to D in the field can be explained by the response of photosynthesis to temperature (T), which normally co-varies with D in field conditions. As photosynthesis decreases with increasing T past its optimum, it may drive a decrease in stomatal conductance (gs) that is additional to the response of gs to increasing D alone. If this additional decrease is sufficiently steep and coupling between A and gs occurs, it could cause an overall decrease in E with increasing D. We tested this mechanism using a gas exchange model applied to leaf-scale and whole-tree CO2 and H2O fluxes measured on Eucalyptus saligna growing in whole-tree chambers. A peaked response of E to D was observed at both leaf and whole-tree scales. We found that this peaked response was matched by a gas exchange model only when T effects on photosynthesis were incorporated. We conclude that field-based studies of the relationship between E and D need to consider signals related to changing photosynthetic rates in addition to purely hydraulic mechanisms.},

Measurements of leaf photosynthesis and transpiration are routinely collected with portable gas exchange instruments, and analysed with a few key models. These models include the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry (FvCB) model of leaf photosynthesis, the Ball-Berry models of stomatal conductance, and the coupled leaf gas exchange model which combines the supply and demand functions for CO2 in the leaf. The 'plantecophys' R package includes functions for fitting these models to measurements, as well as simulating from the fitted models to aid in interpreting experimental data. Here I describe the functionality and implementation of the new package, and give some examples of its use. I briefly describe functions for fitting the FvCB model of photosynthesis to measurements of photosynthesis-CO2 response curves ('A-Ci curves'), fitting Ball-Berry type models, modelling C3 photosynthesis with the coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model, modelling C4 photosynthesis, numerical solution of optimal stomatal behaviour, and energy balance calculations using the Penman-Monteith equation. This open-source package makes technically challenging calculations easily accessible for many users and is freely available on CRAN.},

	abstract = {Attempts to correlate values of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential with particular environmental variables in the field are generally of only limited success because they are simultaneously affected by a number of environmental variables. For example, correlations between leaf water potential and either flux of radiant energy or vapour pressure deficit show a diurnal hysteresis which leads to a scatter diagram if many values are plotted. However, a simple model may be adequate to relate leaf water potential to the flow of water through the plant. The stomatal conductance of illuminated leaves is a function of current levels of temperature, vapour pressure deficit, leaf water potential (really turgor pressure) and ambient CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ concentration. Consequently, when plotted against any one of these variables a scatter diagram results. Physiological knowledge of stomatal functioning is not adequate to provide a mechanistic model linking stomatal conductance to all these variables. None the less, the parameters describing the relationships with the variables can be conveniently estimated from field data by a technique of non-linear least squares, for predictive purposes and to describe variations in response from season to season and plant to plant.},

Temperatures may rise above critical thresholds that allow trees to function optimally, with unknown long-term consequences for forest ecosystems. In this context, we investigated how photosynthetic traits and the water balance in Douglas-fir are affected by exposure to three heat waves with temperatures about 12 °C above ambient. Photosynthetic carboxylation efficiency (Vcmax) was mostly unaffected, but electron transport (Jmax) and photosynthetic rates under saturating light (Asat) were strongly influenced by the heat waves, with lagging limitations on photosynthesis still being observed six weeks after the last heat wave. We also observed lingering heat-induced inhibitions on transpiration, minimum stomatal conductance, and night-time stomatal conductance (gs-night). Results from the stomatal models used to calculate minimum stomatal conductance were similar to gs-night and indicated changes in leaf morphology, e.g. stomatal occlusions and alterations in epicuticular wax. Our results show Douglas-fir’s ability to restrict water loss following heat stress, but at the price of reduced photosynthetic performance. Such limitations indicate potential long-term restrictions that heat waves can impose on tree development and functioning under extreme climatic conditions.},

We examined three traits contributing to longer desiccation times in excised shoots of 11 species from two sites of contrasting aridity: (i) the amount of water released from plant tissues per decrease in xylem water potential (WΨ); (ii) the minimum xylem water potential preceding acute water stress (defined as P50L; water potential at 50\% loss of leaf conductance); and (iii) the integrated transpiration rate between the points of full hydration and P50L (Wtime). The time required for species to reach P50L varied markedly, ranging from 1.3 h to nearly 3 days. WΨ, P50L and Wtime all contributed significantly to longer desiccation times, explaining 28, 22 and 50\% of the variance in the time required to reach P50L. Interestingly, these three traits were nearly orthogonal to one another, suggesting that they do not represent alternative hydraulic strategies, but likely trade off with other ecological strategies not evaluated in this study. The majority of water lost during desiccation (60–91\%) originated from leaves, suggesting an important role for leaf capacitance in small plants when xylem water potentials decrease below −2 MPa.},

There are characters often cited as adaptations to water stress, but links between the function of these traits and adaptation to drying climates are tenuous. Here we combine distributional, climatic, and physiological evidence from 42 species of conifers to show that the evolution of drought resistance follows two distinct pathways, both involving the coordinated evolution of tissues regulating water supply (xylem) and water loss (stomatal pores) in leaves. Only species with very efficient stomatal closure, and hence low minimum rates of water loss, inhabit dry habitats, but species diverged in their apparent mechanism for maintaining closed stomata during drought. An ancestral mechanism found in Pinaceae and Araucariaceae species relies on high levels of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) to close stomata during water stress. A second mechanism, found in the majority of Cupressaceae species, uses leaf desiccation rather than high ABA levels to close stomata during sustained water stress. Species in the latter group were characterized by xylem tissues with extreme resistance to embolism but low levels of foliar ABA after 30 d without water. The combination of low levels of ABA under stress with cavitation-resistant xylem enables these species to prolong stomatal opening during drought, potentially extending their photosynthetic activity between rainfall events. Our data demonstrate a surprising simplicity in the way conifers evolved to cope with water shortage, indicating a critical interaction between xylem and stomatal tissues during the process of evolution to dry climates.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The ability of a plant to survive severe water deficits depends on its ability to restrict water loss through the leaf epidermis after stomata attain minimum aperture. At this stage, the rate of water loss is regulated by the epidermal conductance (gc). Low gc would be a useful selection criterion to identify genotypes with enhanced survival capability. Consequently, variation in gc among Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench genotypes was evaluated. Since there is little conclusive evidence linking gc with leaf waxiness, alternative hypotheses relating gc to stomatal trails were also examined. Epidermal conductance varied from 6.3 to 17.6mmol m−2 s−1 among sorghum genotypes. It was unrelated to stomatal pore length which varied with genotype and to pore depth which was similar for all genotypes measured. However, gc, increased with increasing stomatal density. This indicates that stomatal density plays a direct role in water loss even at very low conductances. The association of low stomatal density with low gc is consistent with the hypothesis that at the smallest stomata aperture, water loss from the epidermis above guard cell teichodes becomes a significant source of leaf water loss. Since low gc is directly related to crop survival under severe water deficits, it is recommended that genotypes with low gc. be selected using the selection criterion of stomatal density.},

	abstract = {Forests in the south-eastern United States experienced a prolonged dry spell and above-normal temperatures during the 1995 growing season. During this episode, nearly continuous, eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes were acquired over a temperate, hardwood forest. These data are used to examine how environmental factors and accumulating soil moisture deficits affected the diurnal pattern and magnitude of canopy-scale carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes. The field data are also used to test an integrative leaf-to-canopy scaling model (CANOAK), which uses micrometeorological and physiological theory, to calculate mass and energy fluxes. When soil moisture was ample in the spring, peak rates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NF) occurred around midday and exceeded 20 μmol m−2 s−1. Rates of NK were near optimal when air temperature ranged between 22 and 25°C. The accumulation of soil moisture deficits and a co-occurrence of high temperatures caused peak rates of daytime carbon dioxide uptake to occur earlier in the morning. High air temperatures and soil moisture deficits were also correlated with a dramatic reduction in the magnitude of NE. On average, the magnitude of NE decreased from 20 to 7 μmol m−2 s−1 as air temperature increased from 24 to 30°C and the soil dried. The CANAOK model yielded accurate estimates of canopy-scale carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes when the forest had an ample supply of soil moisture. During the drought and heat spell, a cumulative drought index was needed to adjust the proportionality constant of the stomatal conductance model to yield accurate estimates of canopy CO2 exchange. The adoption of the drought index also enabled the CANOAK model to give improved estimates of evaporation until midday. On the other hand, the scheme failed to yield accurate estimates of evaporation during the afternoon.},

We compared three commonly used models of stomatal conductance, the Jarvis-Loustau, Ball-Berry and Leuning models, for their suitability for incorporating soil water stress into their formulation, and for their performance in modeling forest ecosystem fluxes. We optimized the parameters of each of the three models with sap flow and soil water content data. The optimized Ball-Berry model showed clear relationships with air temperature and soil water content, whereas the optimized Leuning and Jarvis-Loustau models only showed a relationship with soil water content. We conclude that use of relative humidity instead of vapor pressure deficit, as in the Ball-Berry model, is not suitable for modeling daily gas exchange in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii(Mirb.) Franco) in the Speulderbos forest near the village of Garderen, The Netherlands. Based on the calculated responses to soil water content, we linked a model of forest growth, FORGRO, with a model of soil water, SWIF, to obtain a forest water-balance model that satisfactorily simulated carbon and water (transpiration) fluxes and soil water contents in the Douglas-fir forest for 1995.},

	abstract = {Stomata play a key role in plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions as they control both water losses and CO2 uptake. Particularly, in the context of global change, simulations of the consequences of drought on crop plants are needed to design more efficient and water-saving cropping systems. However, most of the models of stomatal conductance (gs) developed at the leaf level link gs to environmental factors or net photosynthesis (Anet), but do not include satisfactorily the effects of drought, impairing our capacity to simulate plant functioning in conditions of limited water supply. The objective of this review was to draw an up-to-date picture of the gs models, from the empirical to the process-based ones, along with their mechanistic or deterministic bases. It focuses on models capable to account for multiple environmental influences with emphasis on drought conditions. We examine how models that have been proposed for well-watered conditions can be combined with those specifically designed to deal with drought conditions. Ideas for future improvements of gs models are discussed: the issue of co-regulation of gs and Anet; the roles of CO2, absissic acid and H2O2; and finally, how to better address the new challenges arising from the issue of global change.},

	abstract = {Stomatal conductance (gs), net photosynthesis (An) and twig water potential (Ψt) were measured in mature silver birch (Betula pendula) during 3 years in southern Sweden. Measurements from 2 years were used to parameterise three different gs models and measurements from a 3rd year were used to validate these models. Two different multiplicative stomatal models were used. In one of these, the gs response function for the water vapour pressure deficit (D) was fixed, while in the other the gs sensitivity to D increased with the accumulated time after sunrise with D above a certain threshold value. Furthermore, one combined stomatal-photosynthesis model (L-model) was used. The L-model was run either by using observations of photosynthesis as input data, or by predicting gs and photosynthesis simultaneously from environmental data. The model used to predict photosynthesis was parameterised from measurements of the photosynthetic responses to the photosynthetically active radiation, CO2 and temperature. The stomatal response functions of the L-model were parameterised using observations of photosynthesis as input data in order to make them independent of the performance of the photosynthesis model. The difference in model performance between the two multiplicative models was relatively small. The multiplicative stomatal models and the L-model were similarly successful in predicting gs when the L-model was driven by observations of photosynthesis. However, the L-model was considerably less successful when photosynthesis was predicted. Photosynthesis was systematically under- and overestimated at high and low Ψt, respectively, causing errors in the prediction of gs. In most situations, measurements of photosynthesis are not available and gs must be predicted from environmental data. In such cases, we conclude that the two multiplicative models are more successful in predicting gs in mature silver birch than the combined stomatal-photosynthesis model.},
