Droplets (250 to 400 {\^{I}}$\sfrac{1}{4}$m) travelling at low or medium velocity (0.25 to 5 m s{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}1) fractured the dendrites and tubes on leaves of Brassica spp., the tubes on Eucalyptus globulus Labillardere and the ribbons on the adaxial surfaces of Pisum sativum L. and Fragaria ananassa Duchesne. Rates of erosion for Brassica and E. globulus leaves were high during an initial application equivalent to 1 mm rainfall but declined markedly with extended exposure. In contrast, erosion from P. sativum and F. ananassa proceeded at a fairly uniform rate throughout the exposure period. The composition of the detached wax deposits was identical with that of the intact leaf wax for Brassica species but differed for the other species. The practical consequences of wax erosion of field crops are considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Leaf gigantism is an example of marked morphological variation associated with abrupt environmental gradients of increasing coastal exposure. This study characterises the morphology and anatomy of leaf gigantism in four species across two habitats on the coastal headlands of the Tasman Peninsula, Tasmania, Australia. In addition, the genetic basis and adaptive significance of leaf gigantism are examined. Leaf gigantism was characterised in Leptospermum scoparium, Acacia verticillata and Allocasuarina monilifera by greater thickness and succulence, and by greater thickness and increased support tissue in Allocasuarina crassa. Glasshouse-grown seedlings of each species derived from exposed and inland field sites showed that leaf gigantism has both genetic and environmental components. Leaf succulence and a slower growth rate were shown to be heritable in seedlings from the exposed site of L. scoparium and A. verticillata, indicating genetic differentiation. In the reciprocal translocation trial, the higher degree of stress tolerance (as measured by chlorophyll florescence) exhibited by seedlings of L. scoparium and A. verticillata from the exposed site demonstrated the adaptive significance of leaf gigantism in these species. The ecological and evolutionary implications of leaf gigantism on the Tasman Peninsula are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {First-year needles and stems of Abies balsamea were collected at the end of the growing season along an elevational gradient on Mt. Moosilauke, NH. Tissue was sampled from the base (732{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\quotesinglbase}m), midslope (1143{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\quotesinglbase}m), forest limit (1402{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\quotesinglbase}m), and tree line (1455{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\quotesinglbase}m). Mean cuticle thickness on the adaxial needle surface decreased with increasing elevation from 3.01 to 2.21{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\quotesinglbase}{\^{I}}$\sfrac{1}{4}$m. A similar decline was observed for the cutinized cell wall at the lower three elevations. Associated with the decline in cuticular thickness was a 59.3\% increase in the rate of cuticular water loss per gram dry weight from 732 to 1402{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\quotesinglbase}m. The amount of epicuticular wax and other features of leaf anatomy were also examined along the elevational gradient. The high rates of cuticular water loss in these subalpine trees increase the risk of desiccation damage at high elevations and support the concept that they can be a contributing factor in the formation of alpine tree line., Des aiguilles et des rameaux de premi{\~{A}}{\"{}}re ann{\~{A}}{\copyright}e d{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}Abies balsamea ont {\~{A}}{\copyright}t{\~{A}}{\copyright} r{\~{A}}{\copyright}colt{\~{A}}{\copyright}s, {\~{A}}{~} la fin de la saison de croissance, le long d'un gradient altitudinal sur le mont Moosilauke au New Hampshire.

  Abstract                 = {Most aerial plant surfaces are covered with a lipid-rich cuticle, which is a barrier for the bidirectional transport of substances between the plant and the surrounding environment. This review article provides an overview of the significance of the leaf cuticle as a barrier for the deposition and absorption of water and electrolytes. After providing insights into the physico-chemical properties of plant surfaces, the mechanisms of foliar absorption are revised with special emphasis on solutes. Due to the limited information and relative importance of the leaf cuticle of herbaceous and deciduous cultivated plants, an overview of the studies developed with Alpine conifers and treeline species is provided. The significance of foliar water uptake as a phenomenon of ecophysiological relevance in many areas of the world is also highlighted. Given the observed variability in structure and composition among, for example, plant species and organs, it is concluded that it is currently not possible to establish general permeability and wettability models that are valid for predicting liquid-surface interactions and the subsequent transport of water and electrolytes across plant surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {Wind exposure strongly affected needle water relations and mortality in Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa krummholz during winter at timberline in Wyoming. Windward needles had lower water contents, xylem pressure potentials, and viability, compared to leeward needles. Water content and viability increased for windward needles with height above the snow level. Below the snow surface, needle dehydration and mortality were minimal. Both absolute and relative water content were highly correlated with needle viability (a needle viability of near 50\% corresponded to a water content of about 60\% of dry weight). Air temperatures did not drop below -29{\^{A}}$\deg$C in 1980/81, and needle mortality was not correlated with low nighttime needle temperatures. However, dehydration and mortality of wind-exposed needles were associated with low daytime needle temperatures and low cuticular resistance to water vapor loss. A preliminary experiment with excised shoots indicated that summer pre-disposition probably was not the primary cause of winter needle death, and that dehydration and death could have resulted from winter wind exposure alone, perhaps through cuticle abrasion.},

  Abstract                 = {Since its inception, the Farquhar et al. (1980) model of photosynthesis has been a mainstay for relating biochemistry to environmental conditions from chloroplast to global levels in terrestrial plants. Many variables could be assigned from basic enzyme kinetics, but the model also required measurements of maximum rates of photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax), carbon assimilation (Vcmax), conductance of CO2 into (gs) and through (gm) the leaf, and the rate of respiration during the day (Rd). This review focuses on improving the accuracy of these measurements, especially fluxes from photorespiratory CO2, CO2 in the transpiration stream, and through the leaf epidermis and cuticle. These fluxes, though small, affect the accuracy of all methods of estimating mesophyll conductance and several other photosynthetic parameters because they all require knowledge of CO2 concentrations in the intercellular spaces. This review highlights modified methods that may help to reduce some of the uncertainties. The approaches are increasingly important when leaves are stressed or when fluxes are inferred at scales larger than the leaf.},

  Abstract                 = {Peanut genotypes from the US mini-core collection were analysed for changes in leaf proteins during reproductive stage growth under water-deficit stress. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1- and 2-DGE) was performed on soluble protein extracts of selected tolerant and susceptible genotypes. A total of 102 protein bands/spots were analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}TOF MS) and by quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS/MS) analysis. Forty-nine non-redundant proteins were identified, implicating a variety of stress response mechanisms in peanut. Lipoxygenase and 1l-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase, which aid in inter- and intracellular stress signalling, were more abundant in tolerant genotypes under water-deficit stress. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a key enzyme of lipid biosynthesis, increased in relative abundance along with a corresponding increase in epicuticular wax content in the tolerant genotype, suggesting an additional mechanism for water conservation and stress tolerance. Additionally, there was a marked decrease in the abundance of several photosynthetic proteins in the tolerant genotype, along with a concomitant decrease in net photosynthesis in response to water-deficit stress. Differential regulation of leaf proteins involved in a variety of cellular functions (e.g. cell wall strengthening, signal transduction, energy metabolism, cellular detoxification and gene regulation) indicates that these molecules could affect the molecular mechanism of water-deficit stress tolerance in peanut.},

  Abstract                 = {Stomatal conductance (gs) is a key land-surface attribute as it links transpiration, the dominant component of global land evapotranspiration, and photosynthesis, the driving force of the global carbon cycle. Despite the pivotal role of gs in predictions of global water and carbon cycle changes, a global-scale database and an associated globally applicable model of gs that allow predictions of stomatal behaviour are lacking. Here, we present a database of globally distributed gs obtained in the field for a wide range of plant functional types (PFTs) and biomes. We find that stomatal behaviour differs among PFTs according to their marginal carbon cost of water use, as predicted by the theory underpinning the optimal stomatal model and the leaf and wood economics spectrum. We also demonstrate a global relationship with climate. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviour of gs across biomes and across PFTs that can be applied to regional, continental and global-scale modelling of ecosystem productivity, energy balance and ecohydrological processes in a future changing climate.},

  Abstract                 = {Stomata play a significant role in the Earth's water and carbon cycles, by regulating gaseous exchanges between the plant and the atmosphere. Under drought conditions, stomatal control of transpiration has long been thought to be closely coordinated with the decrease in hydraulic capacity (hydraulic failure due to xylem embolism). We tested this hypothesis by coupling a meta-analysis of functional traits related to the stomatal response to drought and embolism resistance with simulations from a soil{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}plant hydraulic model. We report here a previously unreported phenomenon: the existence of an absolute limit by which stomata closure must occur to avoid rapid death in drought conditions. The water potential causing stomatal closure and the xylem pressure at the onset of embolism formation were equal for only a small number of species, and the difference between these two traits (i.e. safety margins) increased continuously with increasing embolism resistance. Our findings demonstrate the need to revise current views about the functional coordination between stomata and hydraulic traits and provide a mechanistic framework for modeling plant mortality under drought conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Drought frequency and intensity are expected to increase in the Mediterranean as a consequence of global climate change. To understand how photosynthetic capacity responds to long-term water stress, we measured seasonal patterns of stomatal (SL), mesophyll (MCL) and biochemical limitations (BL) to net photosynthesis (Amax) in three Quercus ilex (L.) populations from sites differing in annual rainfall. In the absence of water stress, stomatal conductance (gs), maximum carboxylation capacity (Vcmax), photosynthetic electron transport rate (Jmax) and Amax were similar among populations. However, as leaf predawn water potential ({\^{I}}{\"{}}l,pd) declined, the population from the wettest site showed steeper declines in gs, Vcmax, Jmax and Amax than those from the drier sites. Consequently, SL, MCL and BL increased most steeply in response to decreasing {\^{I}}{\"{}}l,pd in the population from the wettest site. The higher sensitivity of Amax to drought was primarily the result of stronger stomatal regulation of water loss. Among-population differences were not observed when gs was used instead of {\^{I}}{\"{}}l,pd as a drought stress indicator. Given that higher growth rates, stature and leaf area index were observed at the wettest site, we speculate that hydraulic architecture may explain the greater drought sensitivity of this population. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of considering among-population differences in photosynthetic responses to seasonal drought in large scale process-based models of forest ecosystem function.},

  Abstract                 = {Responses of forests to changes in environmental conditions reflect the integrated behavior of their constituent species. We investigated sap flux-scaled transpiration responses of two species prevalent in upland eastern hardwood forests, Quercus alba in the upper canopy and Acer rubrum in the low to mid canopy, to changes in photosynthetically active radiation above the canopy (Q(o)), vapor pressure deficit within the canopy (D), and soil moisture depletion during an entire growing season. Water loss before bud break (presumably through the bark) increased linearly with D, reaching 8\% of daily stand transpiration (E-C) as measured when leaf area index was at maximum, and accounting for 5\% of annual water loss. After leaves were completely expanded and when soil moisture was high, sap flux-scaled daily E-C increased linearly with the daily sum of Q(o). Species differences in this response were observed, Q. alba reached a maximum transpiration at low Q(o), while A. rubrum showed increasing transpiration with Q(o) at all light levels. Daily E-C increased in response to daily average D, with an asymptotic response due to the behavior of Q. alba. Transpiration of A. rubrum showed a greater response to soil moisture depletion than did that of Q. alba. When evaluated at a half-hourly scale under high Q(o), mean canopy stomatal conductance (G(S)) of individuals decreased with D. The sensitivity of G(S) to D was greater in species with higher intrinsic G(S). Regardless of position in the canopy, diffuse- porous species in this and an additional, more mesic stand showed higher G(S) and greater stomatal sensitivity to environmental variation than do ring-porous species.},

  Abstract                 = {Significant variation in epidermal conductance was obtained among the 74 soybean accessions tested. When six accessions representing high, medium and low epidermal conductance groups were grown under different environments, it was found that epidermal conductance was sensitive to changes in temperature, relative humidity and water stress. However, analysis of these responses showed that genotypic differences were consistent, although the six accessions possessed varying levels of stability of expression of the trait. Epidermal conductance, therefore, appears to be a physiological trait which might well be utilized in a plant-breeding program for improvement of drought resistance in soybean, should further studies establish its utility for that purpose.},

  Abstract                 = {A field experiment was conducted with a non-irrigated water stress treatment and an irrigated control using four sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) cultivars. We investigated the effects of water deficits on leaf water relations, osmotic adjustment, stomatal conductance, cuticular conductance, cell membrane stability (CMS) measured by the polyethylene glycol (PEG) test, epicuticular wax load (EWL), cytoplasmic lipid content, solute concentration in cell sap, and growth.Osmotic adjustment was observed under water deficit conditions. Lower osmotic potential enabled plants to maintain turgor and decreased the sensitivity of turgor-dependent processes. Sugar and K were identified as the major solutes contributing to osmotic potential in sorghum. Sugar and K concentrations in cell sap increased by 37{\^{A}}$\cdot$4\% and 27\%, respectively, under water deficit conditions in favour of decreasing osmotic potential. Stomatal conductance and cuticular conductance were lower in the non-irrigated plants. A wide range in CMS among four cultivars was observed. CMS increased with increasing water deficits. EWL increased on leaves of water deficient plants and was positively correlated with cuticular conductance and CMS. Membrane phospholipid content increased in water-stressed plants.CMS as measured by the PEG test, was influenced by EWL, cuticular thickness, and osmotic concentration of leaf tissues. The cultivars which maintained higher CMS, higher EWL, lower cuticular conductance, higher turgor and higher osmotic adjustment under water deficit conditions were identified as drought tolerant.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to clarify the relationship between water use efficiency (apparent photosynthetic rate/transpiration rate) and the synthesis and deposition of epicuticular wax and of lipids in leaf internal tissues in various forage crops with different drought tolerance, the contribution of cuticular wax to the leaf cuticular resistance to water loss under water stress was estimated. Under water stress conditions, the cuticular resistance of the drought tolerant plant Chloris gayana Kunth. increased about twofold compared with that of a well-watered plant, whereas the cuticular resistance of the sensitive plant Coix lacryma-jobi L. increased by about 10\%. The amount of epicuticular wax deposited on the leaf surface in both plants increased by water stress. However, the amount in the tolerant plant was much higher than those in the sensitive one. Radioactivity of 14C incorporated into the leaf surface wax of stressed C. gayana and C. lacryma-jobi plants was 27 and 50\% less than that of well-watered plants, respectively, when they were treated with 14C-malonate and 14C-acetate. Leaves of water-stressed C. gayana assimilated 14C from 14C-malonate and 14C-acetate into the lipids of their internal tissues 5.7 times more than the leaves of well-watered plants, while the leaves of water-stressed C. lacryma-jobi assimilated 78\% of the amount recorded in well-watered plants. On the other hand, the cuticular resistance of bloom lines of Sorghum bicolor L. with a high accumulation of wax on the epicuticular surface increased by about 90\% by water stress, whereas the cuticular resistance of a bloomless line with a low amount of wax increased by about only 15\%. Water use efficiency of bloom lines of sorghum increased remarkably by water stress, whereas that of the bloomless line of sorghum decreased. These data suggest that in the drought-tolerant plants the water retention ability of the leaves increased due to the deposition of a larger amount of wax on their leaf surfaces, and a higher accumulation of lipids in internal tissues. Also these plants produced larger amounts of dry matter by increasing the water use efficiency through the reduction of cuticular evaporation under water stress conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {When the stomata are closed under drought, the only route for water loss from the leaf interior to the atmosphere is across the cuticle. Thus, the extent of cuticular transpiration in relation to the reservoirs of water in the plant and the water acquisition from the soil determines the fitness and survival of the plant. It is, therefore, widely assumed that the cuticular water permeability of plants regularly experiencing drought is comparatively low and, thus, adapted to the environment. To test this hypothesis, 382 measurements of cuticular permeability from 160 species were extracted from the literature published between 1996 and 2017. The data had been produced either by using isolated cuticles and astomatous leaf sides or by measuring the minimum leaf conductance under conditions assumed to induce maximum stomatal closure. The species were assigned to 11 life form groups. Except for two particular cases (epiphytes, and climbers and lianas), the cuticular permeabilities of all groups either did not differ significantly or the available data did not allow a statistical test. In conclusion, present knowledge either does not support the hypothesis that ecological adaptions of cuticular water permeability exist or the available data are insufficient to test it.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant survival of severe drought may be especially important in long-life crops such as pastures and rangelands, which might be subjected to prolonged water deficit at some time during their life cycles. While a number of plant traits have been discussed as being beneficial in increasing drought survival, there is virtually no quantitative evidence concerning the relative merits of these traits. This analysis was undertaken with a relatively simple model of plant water balance to calculate the duration of crop survival during exposure to severe water deficits. A low leaf epidermal conductance was an essential factor in prolonging plant survival under drought. The benefit of low epidermal conductance was greatest at a value of 0.10 mm s{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}1, which is less than has been typically reported for annual field crop species. Investigation of the variation and inheritance of epidermal conductance in crops that may be subjected to survival-threatening drought were identified as prime topics for future research. Once a low epidermal conductance has been achieved, additional increases in prolonging plant survival of severe drought can be obtained as a result of leaf shedding and a low lethal relative water content for leaves.},

  Abstract                 = {Stomatal responses to leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (LVPD), leaf water potential components, and cuticular properties were characterized for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) foliage collected from tree tops along a height gradient from 5 m to 58 m in order to explore height-related trends in stomatal sensitivity to LVPD and to investigate the role of bulk leaf turgor and leaf cuticle thickness in determining stomatal behaviour. There were three distinct phases in the response of stomatal conductance (gs) to changes in LVPD. At low LVPD, gs increased with increasing LVPD (phase one). During the second phase, gs was maximal at low to intermediate LVPD and during the third phase gs declined steadily as LVPD increased. The responsiveness of gs to LVPD exhibited a height-related pattern such that maximum gs (gs-max) occurred at progressively greater LVPD with increasing height (r2=0.55, P=0.006). Bulk leaf osmotic potential at full turgor decreased with height (r2=0.77, P=0.00016), and LVPD at gs-max and at maximum crown conductance (gc-max) in the field were significantly correlated with leaf turgor (r2=0.92, P=0.0093). Cuticle thickness increased by 0.044 {\^{I}}$\sfrac{1}{4}$m for every metre increase in height (r2=0.78, P=0.00015). The observed trends in the response of gs to LVPD along a height gradient, and their consistency with height-related trends in foliar osmotic potential suggest that osmotic adjustment at the tops of tall trees influences the relationship between gs and LVPD.},
