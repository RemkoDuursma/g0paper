	abstract = {Circadian resonance, whereby a plant's endogenous rhythms are tuned to match environmental cues, has been repeatedly shown to be adaptive, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Concomitantly, the adaptive value of nocturnal transpiration in C3 plants remains unknown because it occurs without carbon assimilation. These seemingly unrelated processes are interconnected because circadian regulation drives temporal patterns in nocturnal stomatal conductance, with maximum values occurring immediately before dawn for many species. We grew individuals of six Eucalyptus camaldulensis genotypes in naturally lit glasshouses and measured sunset, predawn and midday leaf gas exchange and whole-plant biomass production. We tested whether sunrise anticipation by the circadian clock and subsequent increases in genotype predawn stomatal conductance led to rapid stomatal opening upon illumination, ultimately affecting genotype differences in carbon assimilation and growth. We observed faster stomatal responses to light inputs at sunrise in genotypes with higher predawn stomatal conductance. Moreover, early morning and midday stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation, leaf area and total plant biomass were all positively correlated with predawn stomatal conductance across genotypes. Our results lead to the novel hypothesis that genotypic variation in the circadian-regulated capacity to anticipate sunrise could be an important factor underlying intraspecific variation in tree growth.},

	abstract = {* The role of the circadian clock in controlling the metabolism of entire trees has seldom been considered. We tested whether the clock influences nocturnal whole-tree water use. * Whole-tree chambers allowed the control of environmental variables (temperature, relative humidity). Night-time stomatal conductance (gs) and sap flow (Q) were monitored in 6- to 8-m-tall Eucalyptus globulus trees during nights when environmental variables were kept constant, and also when conditions varied with time. Artificial neural networks were used to quantify the relative importance of circadian regulation of gs and Q. * Under a constant environment, gs and Q declined from 0 to 6 h after dusk, but increased from 6 to 12 h after dusk. While the initial decline could be attributed to multiple processes, the subsequent increase is most consistent with circadian regulation of gs and Q. * We conclude that endogenous regulation of gs is an important driver of night-time Q under natural environmental variability. The proportion of nocturnal Q variation associated with circadian regulation (23–56\%) was comparable to that attributed to vapor pressure deficit variation (25–58\%). This study contributes to our understanding of the linkages between molecular and cellular processes related to circadian regulation, and whole-tree processes related to ecosystem gas exchange in the field.},

  abstract = {Gas-exchange measurements on Eucalyptus grandis leaves and data extracted from the literature were used to test a semi-empirical model of stomatal conductance for CO2, g(sc)=g(0)+a(1)A/[(c(s)-Gamma) (1+D-s/D-0)], where A is the assimilation rate; D-s and c(s) are the humidity deficit and the CO2 concentration at the leaf surface, respectively; g(0) is the conductance as A--$>$0 when leaf irradiance --$>$0; and D-0 and a(1) are empirical coefficients. This model is a modified version of g(sc)=a(1)A h(s)/c(s) first proposed by Ball, Woodrow \& Berry (1987, in Progress in Photosynthesis Research, Martinus Mijhoff, Publ., pp. 221-224), in which h(s) is relative humidity. Inclusion of the CO2 compensation point, Gamma, improved the behaviour of the model at low values of c(s), while a hyperbolic function of D-s for humidity response correctly accounted for the observed hyperbolic and linear variation of g(sc) and c(i)/c(s) as a function of D-s, where c(i) is the intercellular CO2 concentration. In contrast, use of relative humidity as the humidity variable led to predictions of a linear decrease in g(sc) and a hyperbolic variation in c(i)/c(s) as a function of D-s, contrary to data from E. grandis leaves. The revised model also successfully described the response of stomata to variations in A, D-s and c(s) for published responses of the leaves of several other species, Coupling of the revised stomatal model with a biochemical model for photosynthesis of C-3 plants synthesizes many of the observed responses of leaves to light, humidity deficit, leaf temperature and CO2 concentration. Best results are obtained for well-watered plants.},
